# Blakes-Snowboard-Shop

## Description
This is my Flatiron School phase 1 project! This project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to produce a mock store front. This project uses json server to mock the backend of the server. Users are able to "buy" snowboards on the website. They are also able to add their own snowboard for sale. When posting a board for sale, the user must input a picture, brand name, price, and quantity. The new board is then added to the mock database and presented on the website.

## Project Requirements
### Event Listeners
This project uses three distinct event listeners. Those being:
    1. 'DOMContentLoaded'
    2. 'Click'
    3. 'Submit'
